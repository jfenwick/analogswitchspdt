# analogswitchspdt

I was trying to learn how to control a servo using a blue pill. The servo requires external power that is in amps than what the USB port on my PC should really handle. The programmer cable for the board should also not be plugged into the computer at the same time as the external power supply. This means every time I want to program I have to disconnect the servo and the external power supply before plugging in the programmer, and vice versa. This is a board I'm attempting to make in KiCAD that has some DG412 Quad SPST CMOS Analog Switches connected to the two sides. A SPDT switches makes it so I can switch which one is currently active. This means no unplugging, just hitting the toggle switch.
